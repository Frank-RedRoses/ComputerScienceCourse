 * 
 * Euler's sum-of-powers conjecture. In 1769 Leonhard Euler formulated a 
 * generalized version of Fermat's Last Theorem, conjecturing that at least
 *  n nth powers are needed to obtain a sum that is itself an nth power, 
 * for n > 2. Write a program Euler.java to disprove Euler's conjecture 
 * (which stood until 1967), using a quintuply nested loop to find four 
 * positive integers whose 5th power sums to the 5th power of another 
 * positive integer. 
 * 
 * That is, find a, b, c, d, and e such that a5 + b5 + c5 + d5 = e5. 
 * 
 * Use the long data type.

 *  Tests whether there are any five positive integers that satisfy
 *  a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5 = e^5. In 1769 Euler conjectured that no such
 *  solutions exists, but his conjecture was disproved in 1966 using
 *  a method like the one below.
 *
 *  The program reads in an integer command-line argument n and prints
 *  all solutions with a <= b <= c <= d <= e <= n. Restricting attention
 *  to solutions of this form only eliminates duplicates and makes
 *  the program faster since we have many fewer possibilities to try
 *  (675,993,780 vs. 75,937,500,000).
 *
 *  For further efficiency, we use the break statement to avoid explicitly
 *  enumerating certain tuples (a, b, c, d, e), e.g., if a^5 + b^5
 *  is already greater than e^5, there is no need to fix specific
 *  values of c and d and compute a^5 + b^5 + c^5 + d^5.
