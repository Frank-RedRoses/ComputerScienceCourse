What's wrong with the following loop that is intended to compute 
the sum of the integers 1 through 100?

for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
   int sum = 0;
   sum = sum + i;
}

System.out.println(sum);

The variable sum should be defined outside the loop. 
By defining it inside the loop, a new variable sum is initialized to 0 
each time through the loop; also it is not even accessible outside the loop.
