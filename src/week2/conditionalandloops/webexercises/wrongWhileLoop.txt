What's wrong with the following loop?

boolean done = false;
while (done = false) {
    ...
}

The while loop condition uses = instead of == so it is an assignment statement
 (which makes done always false and the body of the loop will never be executed).
  It's better to style to avoid using ==.
  
boolean done = false;
while (!done) {
    ...
}
