What is wrong with the following code fragment?

double x = -32.2;
boolean isPositive = (x > 0);
if (isPositive = true) System.out.println(x + " is positive");
else                   System.out.println(x + " is not positive");

Solution: It uses the assignment operator = instead of the equality operator ==. 
A better solution is to write if (isPositive).
