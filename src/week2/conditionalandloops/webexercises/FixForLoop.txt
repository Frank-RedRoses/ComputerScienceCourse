Change/add one character so that the following program prints 20 xs. 
There are two different solutions.

int i = 0, n = 20;
for (i = 0; i < n; i--)
    System.out.print("x");

Solution: Replace the i < n condition with -i < n. Replace the i-- with n--. 
( In C, there is a third: replace the < with a +.)
