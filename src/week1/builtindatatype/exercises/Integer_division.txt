Why does 10/3 give 3 and not 3.33333333?

Solution: Since both 10 and 3 are integer literals, Java sees no need to type conversion 
and uses integer division.

You should write 10.0/3.0 if you mean the numbers to be double literals. 

If you write 10/3.0 or 10.0/3, Java does implicit conversion to get the same result.
