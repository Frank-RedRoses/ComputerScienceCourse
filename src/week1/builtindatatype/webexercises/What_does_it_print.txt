What does the following code fragment print?

double x = (double) (3/5);
System.out.println(x);

Solution: It prints 0.0, since the 3/5 integer division (with 0 as result) is done before the cast. 


What does the following code fragment print?

int threeInt = 3;
int fourInt  = 4;
double threeDouble = 3.0;
double fourDouble  = 4.0;
System.out.println(threeInt / fourInt);
System.out.println(threeInt / fourDouble);
System.out.println(threeDouble / fourInt);
System.out.println(threeDouble / fourDouble);

Solution: 
System.out.println(threeInt / fourInt);         It prints 0
System.out.println(threeInt / fourDouble);      It prints 0.75
System.out.println(threeDouble / fourInt);      It prints 0.75
System.out.println(threeDouble / fourDouble);   It prints 0.75
