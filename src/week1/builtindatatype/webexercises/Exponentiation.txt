Exponentiation. What is wrong with the following code fragment to compute a2, where a is of type double?

double b = a^2;

Solution: Java does not support exponentiation with the ^ sign (^ it is the exclusive or function from logic).
For cuadratic values use the a*a instead, and for a^b values use Math.pow(a,b).
